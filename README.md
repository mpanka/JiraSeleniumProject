# JiraSeleniumProject

In this project, I used Selenium framework and took care of the test implementation according the POM, KDT and DDT concepts.

# Concepts Included:

Page Object pattern
Keyword driven testing
Data driven testing (with csv files)
Commonly used test utility classes

Selenium Webdriver: Chrome and Chromedriver (UI tests use Chrome by default, can be changed in config)
Java
Maven

# Reporting

I worked in two test scripts one for the login feature and an other for the other features of jira software.
TestScriptLogin has 5 tests, from which 5 test passes. 
TestScript for other features has 11 tests, from which 10 passes.
